This is the repository for the code and model released along with our paper: Human-like Content Analysis for Generative AI with Language-Grounded Sparse EncodersOverviewLanSE (Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders) provides systematic, interpretable analysis of AI-generated content by decomposing images into natural language-described visual patterns. Our method identifies 5,309+ visual patterns achieving 93% human agreement, enabling fine-grained evaluation across four diagnostic metrics:
### Prompt Match: Semantic alignment between generated images and text prompts
### Visual Realism: Detection of unrealistic styles and artifacts
### Physical Plausibility: Identification of physics violations and anatomical impossibilities
### Content Diversity: Measurement of output variation across model generations
